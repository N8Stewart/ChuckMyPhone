# ChuckMyPhone
*Chuck my phone, for Android, will provide users the ability to compete with their friends and against the world in a variety of phone-based competitions. These include throwing their phone as fast, dropping their phone as far, and spinning their phone as rapidly as they can. Users can climb the leaderboards globally or within an area for each competition. Users can also work to unlock badges to exemplify their achievements. If all of your friends started chucking their phones, wouldn't you?
